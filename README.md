# Attention Mechanisms in Neural Networks

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing attention mechanisms in neural networks, with practical examples in Python. The main focus is on **self-attention**, **cross-attention**, and **multi-head attention**, which are crucial in state-of-the-art models for tasks like machine translation, image captioning, and multi-modal learning.

## Overview

Attention mechanisms enable models to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input data, improving performance across a wide range of tasks. This repository includes clear explanations and step-by-step Python code implementations, including:
- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**
- **Multi-Head Attention**
- **Cross-Attention**

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Self-Attention**
Self-attention focuses on relationships within a single sequence. It allows a model to weigh the importance of different parts of the sequence while processing it.

### 2. **Cross-Attention**
Cross-attention allows a model to attend to a different sequence while processing one sequence. This is crucial in tasks where two different sequences interact, such as in sequence-to-sequence models (e.g., machine translation) or multi-modal tasks (e.g., text and image pairing).

### 3. **Multi-Head Attention**
Multi-head attention is an extension of self-attention where multiple attention heads allow the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously. Each head learns different representations, enabling the model to capture diverse relationships in the input data. This is essential in modern models like the Transformer.
